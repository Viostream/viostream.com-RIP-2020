			<ul class="faq">
			  <li class="ques">How is Viostream delivered? <span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">Viostream is a cloud application delivered on a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There is no software to download or infrastructure to invest in. Viostream’s development and infrastructure team deploy updates, enhancements and code refreshes on a monthly basis which benefit all Viostream customers.</li>
			  
			  <li class="ques">How does the per user pricing model work?<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">The user pricing model applies to the size of your active internal audience. So, if you have a department of 1,500 people who you want to be able to use Viostream then your cost would be that number of people times the monthly user price. Based on a sliding scale, the cost per user decreases with larger volumes of people.</li>
			  
			  <li class="ques">What are the standard contract terms?<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">The standard contract term is 12 months with monthly, quarterly or annual billing. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your Viostream licence at any time with 30 days notice.</li>
			  
			  <li class="ques">What is the fair usage policy?<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">We include unlimited streaming bandwidth and video storage for the number of users you have licensed so that you don’t need to worry about variable costs or be financially penalised for video becoming a more successful business tool.
			  
			  To protect Viostream from any potential abuse of this model, we calculate a fair use for the given number of users and add some headroom to accommodate for spikes in usage. If you go above this fair usage limit your account manager will work with you to see if you need to upgrade your package or if there are other reasons for the breach.</li>
			  
			  <li class="ques">Can I upgrade or downgrade my package?<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">Absolutely, we recognise that many customers are on a video journey so you can start with VOD, add LIVE at any point and even upgrade to Enterprise at any point. You can add more users at any time, and if you need to reduce the number of users you can do so at the time of contract renewal.</li>
			  
			  <li class="ques">What other costs do I need to factor in?<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
			  <li class="ans">Viostream is an all-inclusive solution that covers the application, technical support and consumption based data (storage and bandwidth) so you have a stable, predictable cost to budget for.
			  
			  Extensions to Viostream for large scale on-network distribution can typically add 25-40% of the annual costs but these are generally only required for large scale live delivery or organisations that have security requirements that dictate the video must never leave the corporate network.
			  
			  Viostream’s network streaming team offers professional services to identify the most effective way to deliver video on your network, working with your infrastructure team to implement a scalable, reliable approach to managing large scale streaming across internal networks.</li>
