				<p>When the Secretary of Health discovered that it was impossible to address all
				their people at once, their IT and communication leaders began to investigate a
				solution that could connect all of their people. The challenge was to make
				briefings available to everyone, everywhere, across many sites, multiple sub-
				agencies, and disparate IT networks.

				<p>Health TV is a platform for employee engagement, enabling the executive team to
				connect with their people through live interactive briefings. Staff are
				encouraged to attend the Canberra based events in person, or watch from
				common areas on digital signage screens, in remote viewing sites in video
				conference rooms or from desktop and mobile devices.</p>
				
				<p>And the communications team have extended Health TV from a live stream
				platform to become a hub for all video content, and to firmly establish video as a
				core communications channel across the department.
