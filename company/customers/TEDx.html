				<p class="animated fadeInUp">TED recognised early on that events were no longer restricted by four walls. They may take place in a conference centre or hall, but your audience can participate from anywhere in the world. Last year’s TEDxSydney event, for example, attracted a sell-out crowd of more than 4,000 atendees. But, by live-streaming the event on its homepage, Facebook, and The Sydney Morning Herald, it reached an additional 116,000 viewers online, and another 23,000 attendees tuned in at more than 200 satellite events around the world.
