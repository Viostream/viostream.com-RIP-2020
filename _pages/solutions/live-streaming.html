					<h2 class="content-title">Should you live stream your event?
					</h2>
					<p class="mt-3">Live streaming a presentation or event definitely introduces complexity and risk that doesn't exist when capturing it for on-demand viewing. There is a lot more to go wrong, and because it's real time there's little chance to fix it on the fly.</p>
					<p class="mt-3">The benefits are significant though, and generally outweigh the risks; viewers will typically watch 10x longer than recorded content and you have an awesome opportunity to engage and interact with your live stream viewers.
