				<p class="animated fadeInUp">When the ATO began it’s transformational journey, “Reinventing the ATO”, they
				recognised that they needed to engage with their stakeholders in a way that
				would resonate. What they also discovered was that frequently people who had
				trouble finding what they wanted on the ato.gov.au website would go off and
				google their question, and more often than not they’d be directed to a YouTube
				video. The trouble is that almost all of those videos were not from the ATO, and
				so their audience ended up being scattered across the web to tax agents and
				other external parties.

				<p class="animated fadeInUp">ATO has embedded video throughout it’s digital communication, from a series of
				Viostream videos on it’s homepage to ATO TV, a ATO branded video gallery. And
				with the scale and reliability of the Viostream platform, they can be confident of
				handling even the most extreme traffic.

				<p class="animated fadeInUp">ATO also recognised that to change the way they engaged with their external
				stakeholders, they needed innovation in their internal communications to
				transform the way the worked.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animated fadeInUp">With many thousands of employees across the country, the ATO’s internal video
				team deliver live, interactive streams of important updates and departmental
				meetings. Not only does this provide a greater sense of connection and
				inclusiveness in employee engagement, but it also results in significant cost
				savings on travel and time out of the business.</p>
