				<p class="animated fadeInUp">When the Secretary of Health discovered that it was impossible to address all their people at once, their IT and communication leaders began to investigate a solution that could connect all of their people. The challenge was to make briefings available to everyone, everywhere, across many sites, multiple sub-agencies, and disparate IT networks.

				<p class="animated fadeInUp">And the communications team have extended Health TV from a live stream platform to become a hub for all video content, and to firmly establish video as a core communications channel across the department.
