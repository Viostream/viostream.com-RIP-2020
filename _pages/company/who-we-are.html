				<p>Once a year we provide our live streaming services for the Snowdome 'Great Shake Up', a virtual fundraising event a bit like a modern day telethon, that sees hundreds of companies around the country watch the live stream from their boardrooms and donate money. </p>
				<p>
				It's not a huge deal for us - just one event, but each year it helps Snowdome raise nearly half a million dollars just from a single live stream. So it's a big deal for them and a big deal for the Australians with blood cancer that we're indirectly helping.

				<p>The Stolen Generations' Testimonies project, created by Melanie Hogan, and is an initiative to record on film the personal testimonies of Australia's Stolen Generations Survivors and share them online. By allowing Australians to listen to the Survivors' stories with open hearts and without judgement, it is hoped, more people will be engaged in the healing process. The project has been created with the aim of producing a national treasure and a sacred keeping place for Stolen Generations' Survivors testimonies.
