Internet marketing is often defined by a complex customer journey, as consumers <a href="http://viocorp.com/marketing/">engage with video content</a> on a range of different platforms and devices.

These people also discover brands and their content in multiple ways, whether organically, through established social media channels or after their peers share it with them.

Consumers can then engage with this content in the way they see fit. The process ideally culminates in a sale for the business that's distributed the content. A recent initiative from Think With Google analysed the various features consumers look for in online content, which could help companies provide videos that are better tailored to their audience.

<strong>What did Google discover?</strong>

According to Google, the customer journey is comprised of many small steps, which the company termed "micro-moments". The search engine giant found these represent different motivations and feelings as consumers interact with branded content.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The information consumers gather from mobile devices, such as price comparisons, can influence their willingness to buy certain products. Google found that a third of people in the 18 to 34 age bracket are likely to buy a more expensive product if online information, such as marketing videos, can provide a good reason to justify the cost. </span>Google discovered there is significant value in the role of mobile devices in this process, further supporting the <a href="http://viocorp.com/viostream/">demand for online video</a> that is supported by these platforms. Customers frequently seek additional information before making purchases, with 82 per cent of smartphone owners consulting these devices in store.

<strong>How else can video enhance branding efforts?</strong>

Software provider Crayon investigated the global state of online video, finding that this type of content is helping businesses communicate brand messages effectively.

<p class="pullQuote" style="font-size: 1.4em!important; margin: 0!important; width: 100%!important; font-style: italic!important;"><i>Up to 70 per cent of marketers in the B2B sector are increasing the amount of content they release</i></p>

Some important trends regarding online video are still emerging, such as hosting videos on the homepage of a company's website. So far, this relates to only 16 per cent of these pages.

However, there's one trend that's splitting businesses that host videos on their home pages. According to Crayon, there's an almost even split between those that set these videos to play automatically when a user enters the site and those that don't. Just over half (50.2 per cent) are in favour of disabling the option, compared to 49.8 per cent that allow it.

The Content Marketing Institute produced a survey which found that 70 per cent of marketers in the B2B sector are increasing the amount of content they release, with online video a key component in this strategy.
