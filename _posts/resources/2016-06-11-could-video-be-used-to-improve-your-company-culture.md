If you were to ask any business leader what the best part of their organisation was, you'd get a multitude of responses. These would probably include employee engagement, happy customers, profitable industry and growth prospects, just to name a few.

However, when you consider those four points, there is one driving force behind each - company culture. Defined by Forbes as a combination of values, systems, norms and assumptions within a business, company culture can have a major impact of whether or not your organisation is profitable in the market, and the behaviour of the workforce.

Of course, company culture is fragile, which is why it's important to onboard employees who match the philosophy and values of the business. For many Australian companies, culture is having a negative effect on worker retention - as highlighted in a recent Robert Half Australia survey.

<strong>Placing a square in a circle</strong>

There is no doubt that recruitment is a costly exercise, and sometimes business leaders are forced to squeeze a square candidate into a circle part of the puzzle to move forward. Unfortunately, for 66 per cent of the 300 chief financial officers polled by Robert Half, ignoring cultural compatibility has cost them a worker in the past.

Senior Managing Director of Robert Half Asia Pacific David Jones explained this in more detail.

"Being mindful of corporate culture and how well a candidate will fit in within a team is an essential part of the hiring process," he said.

"It can be tempting to solely focus on skills and qualifications but checking whether a candidate's personality matches the corporate work environment makes good business sense too."

While much of the focus on cultural fit can be placed on the candidate themselves, business leaders might need to take a good look in the mirror. Could changes to internal company culture improve the rate of employee retention?

<strong>The role of video</strong>

One perspective worth considering is the use of new technology such as video. If a millennial was hired into your organisation with great skills, a passion for learning and a desire for career development, but wasn't invested in your various internal processes and left, would this be classified as poor recruitment? Probably not, and the situation is a great example of why cultural elements such as habits, assumptions and norms need to change over time to reflect the next generation of employees.

Here is a couple of ways that video can be used to improve company culture.

<strong>1) Videos in emails</strong>

In the office environment, emails are the most common platform for <a href="/want-engagement-add-video-to-your-email/">internal and external communication</a>. However, plain, text-heavy emails can create unengaged workers who simply don't have the time to read a whole company report or update. Of course, visual content is far more engaging than a wall of text and could help business leaders connect to other members of the team - enhancing overall company culture.

An added bonus of videos as part of emails is that analytics can be tracked. This could be through a call to action or view rates, but will show who is invested in team unity and collaboration.

<strong>2) Video in training and development</strong>

Over time, company culture can sour with poor training opportunities at its heart. Without the chance to extend their career prospects, any skilled employee will soon start to turn their back on an organisation - no matter how successful. To address this, <a href="/benefits-of-using-video-for-workplace-training/">video can incorporated into onboarding training</a>, compliance training such as health and safety and ongoing skill development.

These videos don't need to be complicated, but can ensure company culture is positive and everyone is on the same page moving forward.
