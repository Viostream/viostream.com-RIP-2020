<strong>Looks pretty slick doesn’t it?</strong>

Intelligent Details is a short documentary that was commissioned by Bentley Motors and filmed in a Bentley Mulsanne whilst driving through New York. Totally on brand, this video conveys the quality, sophistication and cutting edge technology for which Bentley is renowned.

The whole documentary was shot entirely on an iPhone 5s, and edited with iMovie on an iPad Air in the back of the car.
