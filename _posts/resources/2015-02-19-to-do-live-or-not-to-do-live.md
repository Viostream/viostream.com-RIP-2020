Live streaming is one of the most powerful tools in a communications professional’s arsenal. However, one of the biggest questions is whether it's worth the extra cost to go live or stick to recorded content. It can be hard to know which option to take if you don’t have access to the right information, so let’s have a look at the benefits of both and ask the questions you need to answer to decide which is the right option for you.

<strong>The Benefits of pre-recorded or on-demand video</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>On demand video is straight forward; shoot, edit, post online and re-purpose where possible.</li>
 	<li>A video on-demand (VOD) asset is an extremely effective tool for conveying a message on your site as many times as you like to lots of people.</li>
 	<li>78% of the online population watch at minimum, one video a week.</li>
 	<li>Your audience can search online for the content they want and it will always be available.</li>
 	<li>You have the ability to ‘gate’ premium video content.</li>
 	<li>You can include clickable calls to action in the video to take viewers on a journey</li>
</ul>
So when we get time, we search for the content we need, we watch it and move forward. What if we more engagement from our audience than passive watching? <strong>Live streaming video content is the perfect medium for interaction, engagement and generating a response from your audience. </strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Live video allows real-time engagement through Q&amp;A, live chat, immediate call to arms or social engagement.</li>
 	<li>Live holds attention longer. Viewers watch, on average, live streaming video 10 x longer than on-demand video content.</li>
 	<li>As a direct result of this increased engagement, there is a far greater uptake of information</li>
 	<li>Live video or webcasting also gives you the chance for viewer registration. A registration field is a common gateway and shouldn't be considered a barrier to entry.</li>
 	<li>With registration you can track who is watching your video and their exact engagement stats. These stats will give you immediate insight to understand what your audience needs from you.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Live streams can be converted into on-demand content, so you can get the best of both worlds.</strong>

With minimal effort, you can edit a 30 minute live stream into 5 or more short videos to re -purpose for use in EDMs, corporate updates, presentations or social media. Monitor the videos and use your analytics to find out exactly what resonated with your audience and focus your messaging.

<strong>There are a few factors to consider and a few questions to ask before you decide to commission a live stream:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Do you want interaction with your online audience?</li>
 	<li>Does the communication have urgency? Will the messaging lose effect if it’s not consumed live?</li>
 	<li>Is the content newsworthy enough for people to commit time in their diary?</li>
</ol>
If you answered yes to any of the above, you should really consider a live stream. You may encounter a sense of reticence with live video if it's not something you're used to. Some of the most common objections to the suggestion of live are based around a fear of the unexpected. Keep in mind that 70% of all communications executives use live video in some form already.

Video conferencing, Skype, Google Hangouts and other peer - to - peer video platforms are live video.  Most of us use live video streaming in our every day lives without hesitation. So use live video to your advantage, you can achieve real - time results and generate inertia for your audience to take immediate action.
