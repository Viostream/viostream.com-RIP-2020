<span id="pk-id"></span>How do you connect with the newest generation of workers? Millennials and their neighbours, Generation Z, are both now present, active players in the workforce; and they both have a very different set of communicative requirements from their predecessors Generation X and, of course, baby boomers.

As a marketing resource, video offers companies and managers a <a href="http://viocorp.com/viostream/user-generated/">direct way to connect</a> with customers and future employees - but it can be particularly effective when it comes to connecting with Generation Z and millennials.

<strong>Generation Z</strong>

According to a recent Defy Media report called 'Youth Video Diet', 85 per cent of the 13–24 year old members of Generation Z claimed to watch YouTube more than any other form of video.

The study also found that video was important to this generational bracket for a number of reasons. The main reasons that were outlined as educational, stress-relieving, and connectivity, with members of this generation spending an average of 5.9 hours per week watching social video.

The fact that Generation Z is able to identify and understand its own preferred modes for learning, and be reflexive upon these reasons, is an important factor for businesses to consider. This is clearly a generation that understands its own ways, and will therefore be more receptive to environments that create and instil a relatable culture into the workplace.

<strong>Millennials</strong>

A great deal of market research has been conducted on millennials because of their perceived purchasing power and technological familiarity.

A recent 'Animoto Online and Social Video Marketing' study showed that when it comes to millennials, 80 per cent consider video content when researching a purchase decision, and that 60 per cent of millennials prefer to watch a company video over reading a company newsletter.

Considering this compelling information, could your company benefit from <a href="http://viocorp.com/internal-communications/">embedded video on your intranet</a> over a more traditional company newsletter? A great way to connect with a millennial workforce is by using a cloud-based platform for video that facilitates and encourages staff generated content.

<strong>Why video communication is essential</strong>

Embedded video, both intranet or internal network to desktop, improves <a href="/employee-engagement/">employee communication and engagement</a> by empowering your workforce with content that is engaging and relevant.
