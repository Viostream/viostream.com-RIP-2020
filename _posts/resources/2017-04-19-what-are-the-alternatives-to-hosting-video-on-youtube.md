YouTube's ubiquity as a video sharing site led many organisations to use it to host their own branded content to embed on their corporate website. Some organisations even used it for their private internal communications, relying on the "Unlisted" feature to limit it's discoverability on the platform.

With the recent furore around questionable content on YouTube and the moves from major brands and Government to find a safe harbour for their content, the question is now being asked more frequently than ever;<em> "What can I use to securely publish video content on my intranet or website?" </em>

For organisations who want to effectively control their audience for internal audiences, or maintain a seamless user experience and brand representation for external audiences, there are video platforms designed specifically around these requirements. Here are the key things you need to know about Enterprise Video Platforms:
<h3>What is an Enterprise video platform?</h3>
Enterprise video platforms can be thought of like your own corporate tube. They're designed to store your video content securely and manage all of the streaming so your video can then be published to a branded video gallery, like a private YouTube portal, or embedded into your own site. Check out the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/">ATO.GOV.AU</a> website for a good example of how video is embedded in their site and the <a href="http://tv.ato.gov.au">ATO TV</a> video gallery for a good example of a branded video gallery.

For internal communications video works best when it is also integrated into existing communication channels, such as your <a href="/platform/intranets/">Intranet</a> (e.g. SharePoint), <a href="/platform/learning-management/">Learning Management System</a>, social platform (such as <a href="/platform/social/">Yammer</a>) and your internal emails. Enterprise video platforms will generally have out of the box connectors that make this a seamless experience for both publishers and viewers and are easy to set up.
<h3>Creating Video Content</h3>
Of course before you need a video solution you need to create video content, and an Enterprise video platform makes it <a href="/platform/user-generated/">easy to capture recorded content</a> or broadcast live from your existing devices such as mobiles, tablets and computers as well as video and web conferencing applications.
<h3>Video Management</h3>
As internal video libraries increase in scale (<a href="http://content.viostream.com/australian-internal-communications">64% of Australian organisations have more than 100 videos</a>) then tools such as tagging, channels and metadata to make it easy for you and your viewers to find the right content. Of course, most of the value in a video lies in the dialogue, and interactive transcripts enable in-video dialogue search so your viewers can find the relevant point inside the video.
<h3>Security</h3>
For internal communications, making it easy for your intended audience (and only them) to watch content anywhere and on any device is key. There are a number of relatively simple ways to achieve this, such as <a href="/platform/security/">single sign-on authentication</a> which uses a viewer's existing corporate credentials, or <a href="/platform/security/">domain whitelisting</a> which restricts playback to your internal site such as corporate.intranet.com
<h3>Reporting &amp; Analytics</h3>
One of the key benefits of an enterprise video platform is the insight they can provide into how effective your messaging is, with the ability to measure not just how much your content is being viewed, but <a href="/platform/analytics/">how the information inside is engaging your audience</a>. At an individual level, user level reporting enables you to use video for critical training and report against views for compliance tracking.
<h3>Summary</h3>
YouTube's position as one of the most popular social video sites is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, but recent events have shone the light on the fact that for corporate and Government organisations to securely and effectively source, manage and publish video content there are better options. A good Enterprise video platform will maintain the user friendly, easy to use nature of YouTube and augment that with the integration, control, security and analytics that communication and IT teams need.
