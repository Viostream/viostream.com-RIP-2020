Businesses can <a href="/marketing-communications/">use online video</a> for a number of different purposes, all of which have their own measures of success.

While you might want to measure the success of some content by social shares and comments and others with view time, there is also the option to generate more tangible results for a business.

Lead generation activity is the key to business growth, allowing companies to find new prospects and promote their products to a wider audience. Online video content can play an important part in this, demonstrating your goods and services in an engaging way.

<strong>How can online video become the perfect lead generation tool?</strong>

The first step is to decide how much you want to give away with video content. One option is to prompt viewers to provide personal information - like an email address - in exchange for access.

This could put some people off and limit overall views. However, it does give you a point of contact of those who do watch it, which can then be passed to the sales team to follow up.

Alternatively, you can make the video free and <a href="/platform/call-to-action/">add a call to action</a> that appears either during the video or at the end. This makes the content available to a wider range of viewers, but can sacrifice the amount of information you get in return.

For this option, instead of giving viewers everything they might want to know about your goods or services, structure this content like a teaser - pique their interest, but don't reveal your hand just yet.

<strong>What else should you keep in mind?</strong>

There are a number of other things to keep in mind when creating video content marketing for lead generation purposes.

The first is to link it with the rest of your marketing strategy. Do you have whitepapers or other lead generation tools on your site? Video content can be used as an introduction to this content that then directs prospects to it.

On top this, video content should be spread as far and wide as possible. Ensure that it's shared through your social media profiles. Whether it's through LinkedIn to engage with industry insiders or Facebook to reach customers, online video is definitely a handy tool for lead generation.
