As technology rapidly improves and the use of online video grows phenomenally quickly, it’s important to make sure that your video stands out. Video is proven to be far more engaging than text, yet it is still crucial to maximise viewer engagement.

<strong>How?</strong>

With cleverly placed CTA’s (calls to action), all that hard work you’ve spent creating engaging and compelling video content can be used to generate leads.

Even though they may have already watched the whole video and you have their attention, compel your customers to further engage. CTA’s aren’t just for text based content, but can be used extremely effectively in video to convert views into sales.

With the launch of the Viostream CTA builder that makes it simple to integrate clickable calls to action in video, here’s 5 reasons why using CTA’s is the best thing you will ever do for your business!

<strong>Fact 1:</strong>

46% of users take action after viewing an ad (source: Online Publishers Association).

Don’t lose your customers to someone else - make a call to action mid-way or at the end of your video.

There’s no greater lost opportunity than having impactful video content that gets the desired emotional response from the viewer, but without a convenient and clear path for them to take the desired action.

<strong>Fact 2:</strong>

Retail site visitors who view video stay two minutes longer on average and are 64% more likely to purchase than other site visitors. (Source: Comscore).

Harness this increased engagement and intent to purchase with a call to action like ‘Buy Now’, ‘Contact Us’ or ‘Get a Free Trial’.

<strong>Fact 3:</strong>

Visitors who view product videos are 85% more likely to buy than visitors who don’t. (Source: Internet Retailer).

Need we say more? If your video does what it should, and gives your audience the rational justification they need to purchase don’t make them search for the transaction button – make it instantly available in your video.

<strong>Fact 4:</strong>

The average user spends 88% more time on a website with video. (Source: Mist Media).

You have made a great video that keeps visitors on your site – now tell them what to do next with a clear and timely call to action.

It doesn’t have to shout “BUY NOW!”; your CTA could encourage viewers to watch related videos, subscribe to your blog or access relevant white papers to build your engagement.

<strong>Fact 5:</strong>

92 percent of mobile video viewers share videos with others. (Source: Invodo)

Mobile video is being shared at a breathtaking rate, with every unique view potentially doubling your market with peer endorsed content. Convert this expanded market into sales with a social sharing button integrated in your player.
