It is fair to say that recruitment is a constant battle for business leaders. As soon as one person departs, the whole process starts again, culminating in a new employee progressing through onboarding.

In fact, if statistics from job search website Seek are to be believed, businesses across Australia should be ready for a recruitment boost in 2016. According to a Seek survey, 68 per cent of Australians want to work in a different industry in 2016.

If this is true, it highlights the need for enterprises to sew up their onboarding process. Based on a 2014 BambooHR survey of employees who had resigned within six months of starting a job, 23 per cent noted that the guidelines for their new role weren't clear, while 21 per cent indicated that training was not up to scratch.

Given the cost of recruitment, business leaders should have a <a href="http://viocorp.com/internal-communications/">smart onboarding process</a> in place. This is where video can make a real impact. This article will take a look at how video can prove useful throughout the onboarding process.

<strong>1) Virtual tours</strong>

In a small business, it might be easy for a new employee to be led around the organisation, meeting various members of the team and viewing safety-related locations. However, if the business is split over multiple sites or levels, this might be a time-consuming activity. As such, businesses could create smart virtual tours that highlight these places of interest or importance.

Not only does this add an element of creativity to a normally boring process, employees are more likely to remember something they have watched, rather than read. This is particularly vital in a workplace emergency.

Based on a 2015 CareerBuilder survey, just 25 per cent of employees know how to ensure their own safety in the event of an incident. Whether fire, flood or physical threat, employees should understand where safe places are located - something a virtual tour video can highlight.

<strong>2) Company direction</strong>

For any business to succeed, everyone needs to be on the same page from day one. This said, for a new employee, understanding what this direction or ultimate goal is can be confusing to say the least. This is just one of the reasons why illustrating a mission or vision through the power of video could be a great option to take.

In fact, according to Robert Half, 16 per cent of employees didn't receive an overview of the company at all when they first started. If workers don't know how their performance is helping the business improve overall, this can have a real impact on engagement and retention moving forward.

This is why it can help to base <a href="http://viocorp.com/viostream/user-generated/">introduction videos around business visions</a> where senior management can talk around those key principles in more depth.

<strong>3) Employee testimonials</strong>
<div class="pullQuoteWrapper" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word; width: 25%; float: left; margin: 10px;">
<p class="pullQuote" style="font-size: 1.4em!important; margin: 0!important; width: 100%!important; font-style: italic!important;"><i>Employee testimonials are also a great way to introduce people within a department.</i></p>

</div>
Depending on the industry, it could also be helpful to provide new employees with a "day in the life" video to watch what their colleagues do. By selecting people who have a good work ethic, this can set the standard for the incoming employee.

Based on a 2015 Qumu article, this technique is useful for businesses that are located in multiple places and can act as a best practice example for new employees. Employee testimonials are also a great way to introduce people within a department - even if they haven't personally spoken yet.

It is important to note that these types of videos will need to be continually updated to reflect current work responsibilities.
