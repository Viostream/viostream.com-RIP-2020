							<h3>Give your people a voice</h3>
							Live stream town hall briefings to connect with all of your people everywhere and bring the audience into the conversation with integrated commenting, Q&amp;A for live events and the ability to easily capture and contribute their own videos.

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<div class="right text">
							<h3>Make the information in your video easy to get at</h3>
							Searchable dialogue makes it possible to find the spoken words in a video, and chapters make the content in longer videos easier to access. Viostream’s in-built workflow converts your video into captions, making WCAG accessibility compliance a breeze and making your content viewable in any environment, like on the train or in an open plan office.

							Video viewing doesn’t have to be a sit-back experience. Let your audience interact with your videos with clickable elements in the video that turn views into outcomes. And with engagement analytics and user-level tracking, you can turn your video content into valuable compliance and training tools.

							<h3>Upgrade your intranet with streaming video </h3>
							Intranet platforms usually suck at video streaming, so Viostream makes it easy to record and share video content on your digital workplace or intranet platform. Flexible publishing options include simple script or iFrame embed, distribution API or native connectors for common platforms like SharePoint and Squiz Matrix.

							<h3>Stream video on your network without breaking it</h3>
							Your IT team will probably have kittens when you talk about large scale use of streaming video, but Viostream helps them overcome their bandwidth challenges with efficient video distribution that minimise the impact of large numbers of viewers on the corporate network. Flexible delivery options help your IT department leverage existing network infrastructure, so they won’t need to spend millions investing in a dedicated video network across your sites.

							<h3>Control access seamlessly</h3>
							Viostream’s Single Sign-On access supports integration with your internal corporate directory so you can control who gets to view what videos across your organisation without the need for additional usernames and passwords. Viewer access to Viostream media and video galleries is controlled by using the SAML 2.0 protocol for SSO user authentication.
