					<p class="mt-3">You already have hundred if not thousands of video creation devices and applications across your organisation. Smartphones and tablets, laptops and desktops invariably have HD video cameras. Your unified comms, web conference and video conference most likely have the ability to capture recordings.</p>
					<p class="mt-3">At the other end of the chain, you have intranets, collaboration and social tools, learning management systems and digital signage. On each of those screens are users that are hungry for video content</p>
					<p class="mt-3">Viostream helps you connect the dots with a video streaming hub designed to align with your existing tech stack. </p>

					<h2 class="content-title">Scalability in a cloud application</h2>
					<p class="mt-3">Viostream is a cloud application, providing a highly available, scalable backbone for video storage, management and distribution. Providing adaptive bitrate live and on-demand video streaming through a global content delivery network, Viostream supports video consumption at scale on the corporate network with a highly efficient distribution solution that reduces network impact to a minimum.</p>
					<p class="mt-3">Viostream’s internal streaming options leverage your existing investment in WAN optimisation, caching infrastructure or eCDN, complementing these with lightweight streaming server or P2P media distribution solutions to provide remote sites with quality, reliable viewing of live and on-demand video utilising intelligent policy based traffic and bitrate control for predictable levels of performance.</p>

					<h2 class="content-title">Turn the words and images in video into structured data</h2>
					<p class="mt-3">Video content is historically opaque and unstructured data, with no insight into the information contained other than the file name and a (often useless) description. </p>
					<p class="mt-3">Viostream’s in-built workflow creates timed text versions of your videos, with an integrated search function to turn the spoken words in your video into a powerful, searchable information resource.</p>

					<p class="mt-3">Viostream is built with enterprise security at it’s core, providing business administrators complete control over their video assets with permission based user roles, active directory authentication, secure content delivery, flexible storage options and audit logs.</p>
