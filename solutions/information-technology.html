					<p class="mt-3">Viostream is a cloud application, providing a highly available, scalable backbone for video storage, management and distribution. Providing adaptive bitrate live and on-demand video streaming through a global content delivery network, Viostream supports video consumption at scale on the corporate network with a highly efficient distribution solution that significantly reduces network impact.</p>
					<p class="mt-3">Viostream's internal streaming options leverage your existing network infrastructure to provide remote sites with quality, reliable viewing of live and on-demand video utilising intelligent policy based traffic and bitrate control for predictable levels of performance.</p>
