					<h2 class="content-title">Searchable video</h2>
					<p>Interactive transcripts make the words in your video searchable, matching a timed transcript file with a visual display and search function to turn the spoken words in your video into a powerful, searchable information resource. Speech search allows your viewers to find any phrases in the video dialogue that contain their search term, and seek directly to those points in the video.
