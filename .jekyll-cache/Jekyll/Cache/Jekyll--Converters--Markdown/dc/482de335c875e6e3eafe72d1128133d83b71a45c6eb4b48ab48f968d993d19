I"Â<p>Online video is fast becoming the dominant form of communication around the world, and with good reason. Video lets you convey a whole range of information, emotions and experiences that simply arenâ€™t possible with still images or text.</p>

<p>In fact, <em><strong>Cisco predicts the year 2019 will see 72 per cent of mobile data composed of video content</strong></em> - a substantial increase on current levels.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of video as a communication tool has also become a major talking point in recent months. Facebooks decision to become a video-focussed organisation in the last year, for example, has seen the site quadruple the number of videos people are watching through their news feed. Twitter too, has moved into this sector - acquiring the live streaming app Periscope earlier this year.</p>

<p>Whats more, peoples attention spans are getting shorter as they become better attuned to processing large amounts of content. According to research from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, the average attention span in 2015 has dropped to 8.25 seconds, down from 12 seconds in 2000.</p>

<p>The same study found the <em><strong>average online video is watched for only 2.7 minutes.</strong></em></p>

<p>For organisations, this presents a golden opportunity to prepare now so they are ahead of this new trend and prepared for the future. This requires companies to master two different aspects that ensure the success of a video - understanding what makes a video engaging to viewers and having metrics to support this decision.</p>

<p><strong>What makes people engage with a video?</strong></p>

<p>This first step towards getting video content right is combining a creative approach with a solid understanding of what exactly it is that makes a video appealing in the first place.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors to consider is editing - even the shortest recording will require planning and editing in order to be engaging to an audience. This should begin with pre-production outlining the content and then careful editing to ensure the message is delivered effectively.</p>

<p>Videos, like all communications, also need to tell a story. As well as planning out a video around these goals, itâ€™s important to consider how your video title and description can all align with the story you are trying to tell.</p>

<p><strong>How are people engaging with your video?</strong></p>

<p>The number of times a video has been watched is only the beginning of <a href="http://viocorp.com/manage/?tab=6">analysing your video</a> content to really understand how effective a video is requires much more in-depth information.</p>

<p>A recent article, published in the Harvard Business Review, suggests five video metrics that every company should be watching for their video content:
Who is watching?Â - the number of people watching a video divided by the number visiting the page.
Average engagement - how long are they watching for?
Action completions - how many people follow through with a call to action.
Comments and social shares.</p>

<p>The article also suggested focusing on non-video metrics that can also indicate if a video is adding to your companies online presence. For a website, video content should be reducing bounce rates and increasing the average time spent on a page.</p>
