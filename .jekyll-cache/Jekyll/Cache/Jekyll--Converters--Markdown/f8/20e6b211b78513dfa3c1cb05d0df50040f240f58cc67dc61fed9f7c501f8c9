<p>Thanks to advancements in hosting technology, <a href="http://viostream.com/platform/call-to-action/">online video</a> no longer has to be a passive medium where audiences simply sit and watch.</p>

<p>This is especially important for external communications, as viewers can now be prompted to further explore the website, watch more content, or maybe even place an order.</p>

<p>With these trends currently finding favour amongst businesses across the globe, interactive online video is providing yet another platform for companies to create innovative communication channels. It also means that those who are still on the fence about the value of video content are missing out on further developments in the sector.</p>

<p><strong>How is interactive video changing external communication?</strong></p>

<p>Essentially, adding interactive touches to <a href="http://viostream.com/marketing-communications/">video content marketing</a> adds a further dimension to the viewer’s experience, increasing engagement. A 2013 report from Ernst &amp; Young discovered that interactive media was one of the fastest growing communication platforms accounting for 22 per cent of all growth in the industry between 2009 and 2013.</p>

<p>EY Global Media and Entertainment Leader John Nendick said businesses were catching on to the value inherent in digital media, with the rise in interactivity leading these trends.</p>

<p>“Media and entertainment companies are maintaining and growing their businesses primarily by growing their digital revenues and scaling back overhead associated with traditional media,” he explained.</p>

<p>A report produced by Forrester Research and Rapt Media revealed there was a noticeable difference in the results between linear video options and the interactive alternatives. The pair found that more than 90 per cent of all online videos with interactive features were watched to completion white other content sat in the 50 to 85 per cent range.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the best way to include interactive elements?</strong></p>

<p>According to an August 25 article published by Variety, the key is to seamlessly integrate the interactive elements in a video with the rest of the content. CEO at Cinematique Randy Ross said failing to do this can be detrimental to the overall quality of the video.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing worse than getting pop-ups over video,” he explained. “It disrupts the experience.”</p>

<p>It’s also important to plan where you want video content to direct viewers. If your video is supported by calls to action, these should complement the subject matter and create a tangible link between your message and the goods or services it directs to.</p>

<p>Alternatively, create a path to further videos to give viewers a tour of your product lineup.</p>
