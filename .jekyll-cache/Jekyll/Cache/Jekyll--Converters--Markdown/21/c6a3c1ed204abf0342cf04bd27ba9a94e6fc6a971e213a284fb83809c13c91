<p>Internet marketing is often defined by a complex customer journey, as consumers <a href="http://viocorp.com/marketing/">engage with video content</a> on a range of different platforms and devices.</p>

<p>These people also discover brands and their content in multiple ways, whether organically, through established social media channels or after their peers share it with them.</p>

<p>Consumers can then engage with this content in the way they see fit. The process ideally culminates in a sale for the business that’s distributed the content. A recent initiative from Think With Google analysed the various features consumers look for in online content, which could help companies provide videos that are better tailored to their audience.</p>

<p><strong>What did Google discover?</strong></p>

<p>According to Google, the customer journey is comprised of many small steps, which the company termed “micro-moments”. The search engine giant found these represent different motivations and feelings as consumers interact with branded content.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The information consumers gather from mobile devices, such as price comparisons, can influence their willingness to buy certain products. Google found that a third of people in the 18 to 34 age bracket are likely to buy a more expensive product if online information, such as marketing videos, can provide a good reason to justify the cost. </span>Google discovered there is significant value in the role of mobile devices in this process, further supporting the <a href="http://viocorp.com/viostream/">demand for online video</a> that is supported by these platforms. Customers frequently seek additional information before making purchases, with 82 per cent of smartphone owners consulting these devices in store.</p>

<p><strong>How else can video enhance branding efforts?</strong></p>

<p>Software provider Crayon investigated the global state of online video, finding that this type of content is helping businesses communicate brand messages effectively.</p>

<p class="pullQuote" style="font-size: 1.4em!important; margin: 0!important; width: 100%!important; font-style: italic!important;"><i>Up to 70 per cent of marketers in the B2B sector are increasing the amount of content they release</i></p>

<p>Some important trends regarding online video are still emerging, such as hosting videos on the homepage of a company’s website. So far, this relates to only 16 per cent of these pages.</p>

<p>However, there’s one trend that’s splitting businesses that host videos on their home pages. According to Crayon, there’s an almost even split between those that set these videos to play automatically when a user enters the site and those that don’t. Just over half (50.2 per cent) are in favour of disabling the option, compared to 49.8 per cent that allow it.</p>

<p>The Content Marketing Institute produced a survey which found that 70 per cent of marketers in the B2B sector are increasing the amount of content they release, with online video a key component in this strategy.</p>
