I"”<p>From a product launch to a conference, any speaking event where your staff and expertise are on display is also a chance to increase the reach of your message.</p>

<p>In recent years, corporate events and presentations have become more important than ever. Product launches from major tech companies like Apple and Samsung are often headline news, beamed around the world, both live and then streamed later on.</p>

<p>While your next event might be a little more low key than these, there is no reason not to assume there is an audience out there who would be interested in seeing your brand in action. In this situation, live streaming is a simple strategy that can help your organisation tap into a rapidly growingÂ potential audience.</p>

<p><a class="bodyLink" href="/platform/webcast-production/">Live streaming video</a>Â is a rapidly growing medium and is seeing substantial growth. According to theÂ FreeWheel Video Monetization Report from the final quarter of 2014, <strong>live viewing of events grew by 297 per cent that year.</strong></p>

<p>So is it time to live stream your next event? Hereâ€™s a checklist that can help you make this decision:</p>

<p><strong>Does your company have a dispersed workforce?</strong></p>

<p>Live streaming is great for internal communications, especially if staff are spread over a number of different sites or countries and cannot attend an event in person.</p>

<p><strong class="bodyLink">Are you looking for interactive engagement duringÂ an event?</strong></p>

<p>One of the greatest advantages of a live streamÂ is it gives viewers the opportunity to comment on an event or ask questions to the presenter in real time. Just as a panel might take questions from the audience, a live-streamed event can take questions through a comments section or online Q&amp;A. If you simply posted a video recording after the event, you will have missed an opportunity to interact with and engageÂ your audience.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also important to remember that a live stream doesnâ€™t have to end once the event is over. That same content can be repurposedÂ and put to use as <a class="bodyLink" href="http://viostream.com/platform/">on-demand video</a>, giving it a further life beyond that one event.</p>
