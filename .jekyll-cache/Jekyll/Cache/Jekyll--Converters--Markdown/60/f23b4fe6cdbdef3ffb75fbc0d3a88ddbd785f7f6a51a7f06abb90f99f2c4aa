I"I<p>A massive amount of internal and external communication is conducted through email, the most common channel of choice for business and government organisations. With their wide reach, emails can quickly overwhelm recipients, especially if companies do not have a strategy to engage audiences efficiently.</p>

<p>As over saturation is a key concern in any popular market, businesses are responsible for crafting unique content that separates them for their competition, ensuring that important messages are not lost in a sea of information. Rather than bombarding recipients with screeds of overwhelming text, businesses should be seeking ways to create engaging content, making it easier and more enjoyable to consume.</p>

<p>This is where videos come in, resulting in visual content which is proven to be more engaging than the wall of text some emails lead with.</p>

<p><strong>So, what do you need to be thinking about when you start using video?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Make sure they work across all devices</strong></p>

<p>Unlike a few years ago, you can no longer assume emails will be opened on desktop computers. The mobile nature of today’s workforce means emails and the content they deliver needs to be optimised for everything from tablets to smartphones. This means these videos will be at the mercy of different screen sizes and speaker setups. Email marketing specialist Litmus discovered that more emails than ever are being opened on mobile platforms, highlighting the need to have versatile and engaging content that can reach viewers at their workstation or on the go. According to Litmus, back in 2011 only 8 per cent of all emails were received and opened on mobile devices. By the end of last year, that number had risen to just under half (48 per cent), marking a 500 per cent increase in just four years.</p>

<p><strong>Track the results</strong></p>

<p>While it my be tempting to start adding videos to emails without giving them any further thought, this is not the best way to go about it. To get the most out of these initiatives, metrics and statistics need to be tracked so you can ensure the content is reaching its target audience. These programs aren’t quite a magic bullet to fixing communication issues, so some tweaking may be required to ensure they are at their most effective. This can also mean more than just analysing opening and click-through rates, as videos have the chance to take on a life of their own after being sent into the public sphere. The shareable nature of this content means that employees or members of the public can further spread the message if they think it’s worth passing on. In some cases, this could cause the video to go viral, helping your content to reach new audiences and draw attention to your brand.</p>
