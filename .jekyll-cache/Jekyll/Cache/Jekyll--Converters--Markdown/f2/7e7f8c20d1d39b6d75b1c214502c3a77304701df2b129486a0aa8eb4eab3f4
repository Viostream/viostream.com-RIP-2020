I"Ü<p>Like many essential business procedures, training new hiresÂ and updating current employee training programmes can quicklyÂ become stale if efforts arenâ€™t made to freshen up content or try something different.</p>

<p>For businesses that want to offer employees the chance to learn the ins and outs of the company in a more engaging way, producing video content is one ofÂ the best ways to achieve this and bringÂ training into the 21stÂ century.</p>

<p>This doesnâ€™t necessarily sacrifice the human element of teaching your workforce either, as managers can still be on hand to add to theÂ content displayedÂ on screen orÂ bring an interactive element.</p>

<p>There are always moreÂ inventive ways to approach training, so if youâ€™re still stuck doing things the analogue way, hereâ€™s how <a class="bodyLink" href="/platform/">video streaming solution</a> can bring your training methods into the 21st century:</p>

<p><strong>1. Make training flexible</strong></p>

<p>The modern workplace is a busy environment and taking time out of daily routine for extra training often puts a strain on employees whoÂ are already under pressure. This is where video training succeeds and old methods fail.</p>

<p>Previously, managers would have to organise a time that suited everyone, taking up valuable time and space to ensure all employees could receive training at the same time and place. Now, employees can simply be assigned a set of training videos to view at their leisure.</p>

<p>With Viostream, you can be sure videos are viewable on any platform staffÂ have access to, an important feature in an age where an increasing numberÂ of employees are working on devices theyâ€™ve supplied themselves.</p>

<p>This is set to become even more important in the coming years, with Gartner discovering that 38 per cent of companies will require employees to supply their own devices by the end of next year. By securing your <a href="/learning-and-development/">video training with Viostream</a>, your content is ready to adapt with future tends.</p>

<p><strong>2. Reach remote employees</strong></p>

<p>The world is smaller than it ever was before thanks to the internet. Now - with video especially - itâ€™s easy to connect offices and company departments in remote locations and ensure they are all receiving the same message.</p>

<p>Not only is it time saving, itâ€™s cost saving as well. If your business relies on specialised professionals to deliver training solutions to your company, it can be expensive to ship them across cities, states or even countries.</p>

<p>With video content, training and education information can be easily transmitted anywhere, which is perfect for businesses that operate in remote locations that provide logistical challenges.</p>

<p>On top of this, itâ€™s easy to add to the training, simply record another video with the updated information and distribute it throughout your business.</p>

<p><b>3. Ensure it matches your workplace culture</b></p>

<p>Like all areas of your business, internal video content should reflect the culture and values of your business. While it is important to have video content that is entertaining and engaging, if this comes at the expense of sending consistent messagesÂ then it could be doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>This is especially important for video content that is targeting health and safety initiatives, for example, as humour and entertainment value could come at the expense of the message you are trying to get across.</p>

<p>According to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), the way these messages are imparted hasÂ a significant effect on the safetyÂ culture within the workplace. To take this content to the next level, the ACC recommends providing room for staff feedback, so video content should direct employees to further resources or have a relevant call to action.</p>
