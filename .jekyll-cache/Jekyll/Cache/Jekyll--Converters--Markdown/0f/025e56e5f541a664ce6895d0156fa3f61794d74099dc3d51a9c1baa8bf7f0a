I"¡<p>The world is getting smaller and the way we host and plan our events is changing, businesses need to manage global as well as local interest.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that itâ€™s unlikely that everyone who wants to attend will be able to. Previously, these people would be left either reading a summaryÂ after that fact or missing out entirely. Thanks to <a class="bodyLink" href="http://viostream.com/platform/webcast-production/">the beauty of live streaming</a> however, important speeches and presentations, or even whole events,Â can be viewed in real time by people throughout the country and across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Event budgets on the rise</strong></p>

<p>According to Meeting Professionals International (MPI) there is a projected rise in event budgets across the globe, but how will businesses leverage this extra spending power?</p>

<p>While itâ€™s not a massive rise - MPI envisions growth of just under 2 per cent -Â when combined with other trends the company observed this should be more than enough motivation for businesses to pursue live streaming.</p>

<p>In fact, itâ€™s the growth in â€œvirtual attendanceâ€ that event planners should be keeping their eye on, as the MPI research found companies have faith in this approach <a class="bodyLink" href="http://viocorp.com/reach/">gaining more exposure</a>.</p>

<p>Over the next year, more than half (56 per cent) of companies surveyed believe theÂ amount of people viewing live streams of their events will grow. According to Vice President Event Technology Solutions at CCR Event Technology Rental Kelly Kucera, this investment is about growing a brand and spreading information.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™re seeing a lot of people who are willing to expand a little bit more and maybe spend a little more money to get theirÂ message across,â€ she said.</p>

<p><strong>How will people watch live streams?</strong></p>

<p>With the mobile nature of todayâ€™s workforce, you can bet that people wonâ€™t be stuck to a desktop when theyâ€™re watching live streams of your event. Technology research company Gartner has found that mobile data use is set to grow yet again as the year progresses and more employees perform work tasks on their mobile devices.</p>

<p>According to the firm, total mobile data use will increase by 59 per cent by the end of 2015. However, thatâ€™s not the most interesting stat for streamers. There has been a notable shift in the demographics that are consuming video content. GartnerÂ found that more people within the 47-54 age bracket are streaming video content than 18-24 year olds, with results of 47 and 40 per cent respectively.</p>

<p>For businesses looking to target working professionals with their live streams, this is confirmation there is an audience waiting for them.</p>
