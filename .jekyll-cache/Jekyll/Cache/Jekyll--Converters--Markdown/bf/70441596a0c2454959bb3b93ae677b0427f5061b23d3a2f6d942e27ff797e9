I"Ã<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rise of social media has led to an interesting trend - people are able to <a href="http://viocorp.com/events/"><span class="s2">cover events as they happen</span></a> and share them with the world using just their smartphones. It's certainly a significant shift for how people access news - platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat are rapidly becoming noteworthy alternatives to traditional news outlets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key here is user generated content: People can create video content or take pictures and share them with a much larger audience. So what are the benefits, and how can businesses take advantage of this development?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The benefits of user generated content</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enabling staff to create their own video content and then share it with the business can be an excellent investment. Once the appropriate systems are in place, companies will see a number of benefits.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Staff become contributors: With the systems in place, staff can create relevant content for the business from trade shows, conferences and even within the company itself.</span></li>
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Fast uploading: Staff can shoot video and then upload without delay. If something noteworthy happens, staff can record it.</span></li>
 	<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Moderation: Businesses can approve content shot by staff, so there's no risk of irrelevant or malicious video going live on the website.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how can businesses get started? Using the right solution will enable companies to start a user generated content system correctly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Utilising the right solution</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Viostream is one of the best ways to kick start user generated content. It's a way to take advantage of the trend, while maintaining a high level of security and granting communication freedom.</span></p>
